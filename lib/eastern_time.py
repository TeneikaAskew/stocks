"""The one place the trading platform's Eastern timezone is defined.

Eastern time is **America/New_York** -- a named, DST-correct IANA zone. It is
never a fixed offset (``EST`` / ``-05:00`` freezes the clock at winter time
through the summer) and never the backward-compatibility link ``US/Eastern``
(which is absent from slim tzdata images). Import :data:`ET` (a
``zoneinfo.ZoneInfo``) or :data:`ET_NAME` (the string, for the pandas and pytz
APIs that take a name) from here rather than constructing the zone locally, so
there is a single source of truth and the startup check below vouches for every
use of it at once.

This replaces the repository-wide source scanner that previously enforced the
same invariant by grepping every file: a single canonical helper plus a boot
assertion is a fixed target that cannot drift, where the scanner had to chase
every new way to spell a fixed offset.
